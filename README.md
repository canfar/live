# CANFAR Issues, Bugs, Feature Requests

You can use the GitHub general issue tracker:
  - https://github.com/canfar/live/issues if you have a GitHub account
  - https://gitreports.com/issue/canfar/live if you don't have one and don't want to register at GitHub

Or better: you can directly file an issue to one of the CANFAR project repository:
  - https://github.com/canfar
